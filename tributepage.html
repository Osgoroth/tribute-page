        <p>An 'abridged' timeline of Zelenskyy's presidency:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>December 31, 2018</strong> - Announces his candidacy in the
            2019 presidential election.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>April 21, 2019</strong> - Zelensky is elected president,
            defeating incumbent Petro Poroshenko with 73.22% of the vote.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>May 20, 2019</strong> - Sworn in as the 6th president of
            Ukraine. In his inaugural address, Zelensky dissolves the current
            Ukrainian parliament and orders a parliamentary election. He also
            announces his intention to achieve a ceasefire in Donbas, a region
            in eastern Ukraine which is the site of hostilities between
            Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>July 2019</strong> - Zelensky’s Servant of the People party
            wins an outright majority in parliamentary elections.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>January 27, 2022</strong> - Amid a buildup of Russian troops
            at the Ukrainian border, Biden and Zelensky hold a phone call in
            which Biden warns that a Russian attack may be imminent. Zelensky
            tells reporters the following day that world leaders have been
            overstating the likelihood of war between Ukraine and Russia.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>February 24, 202</strong>2 - Russian military forces enter
            Ukraine and begin a full-scale assault across airfields, military
            headquarters, major cities and ports. Zelensky introduces martial
            law and urges calm, “We are strong. We are ready for everything. We
            will win over everybody because we are Ukraine.”
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>April 3, 2022</strong> - After reports of alleged Russian
            atrocities in the town of Bucha near Kyiv, Zelensky calls for an end
            of Russian “war crimes.” In his address, Zelensky announces a
            “mechanism of justice” will be established to investigate crimes
            committed by Russian soldiers in Ukrainian territory.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>September 30, 202</strong>2 - Putin announces that Russia
            will seize four Ukrainian regions, in an annexation process which is
            illegal under international law. Zelensky calls the move a “farce”
            in a pre-recorded video statement and vows that “the entire
            territory of our country will be liberated.” Zelensky also said his
            country would apply for NATO membership “under an accelerated
            procedure,” but it’s unclear how long such a process will take.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>December 7, 2022</strong> - Time magazine names Zelensky its
            “Person of the Year.”
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>December 21, 2022</strong> - During a surprise trip to the
            United States, Zelensky meets with Biden at the White House, and
            delivers a speech to a joint meeting of Congress, making a plea for
            more help fighting Russia. It is his first trip outside Ukraine
            since the war began in February.
